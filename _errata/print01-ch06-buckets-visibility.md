The second sentence of the second paragraph says somewhat unclearly:

> We could fix this by making the `buckets` field visibility `pub(crate)`

The sentence would be easier to understand if it were expressed like so:

> We could fix this by setting the visibility of the `buckets` field to `pub(crate)`
